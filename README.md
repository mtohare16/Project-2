# Project-2
#Express Movies App
--
###Overview
--
For Project 2 I have created an express movies app where you can create an account and add movies to your list. Your list can clarify what the title is, the genre, and whether or not you have watched it before. Each account has its own private movie list.

###Future Development

--

- Began working on integrating a movie API so that the user can generate and look for movies based on their title, genre, release year, etc. 
- Need to create a delete function for each of the movies so that a user can also delete movies if they change their minds.
